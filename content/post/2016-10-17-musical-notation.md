So I need a way of recording my learnings about Jazz music. Mostly because I can barely keep track of my life in general.

Turns out there's a sweet library called [abc.js](https://abcjs.net). It renders the ABC syntax for music! I used to use Lilypond, but this is a nice subset, suitable for webpages.

Well, the minified version is 487kb, which you all have already downloaded just by visiting this website. Sorry about that!

As a test, I have posted one of the jazz licks I am learning in this post. In a future blog post, I shall talk about things I have learnt about each lick.
