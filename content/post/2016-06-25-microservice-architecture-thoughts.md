# Composing

So it turns out that some people actually have interest in what I (attempted to) build with regards to the microservice trading platform I mentioned a few posts ago. I ended up doing a screencast to try and explain what I've done so far with my app and how it all plugs together.

Thanks to Oren Golan for setting this up! [The link to the post is here](https://oren.github.io/blog/micro.html).
