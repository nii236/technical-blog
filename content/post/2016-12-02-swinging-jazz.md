So I had a piano lesson today.

I've been learning Charlie Parker's "Dexterity" for the past few weeks.

Some interesting points follow.

# Comping yourself

With chords in bebop, the tempos are usually too fast to be able to play two handed chords. Keep it to simple Bud Powell voicings.

- Root and 7
- Root and 3
- 3 and 7. Only for dominant chords, otherwise it will sound like a different chord
- 7 and 3. Only for dominant chords, otherwise it will sound like a different chord

Chordal expectation is a thing. Hit chords either after or before beat 3 depending on what the melody is doing.

# The tune

Very quick, I need to work on my timing.

- It helps to be able to count in 8ths to be able to fit the weird semi quaver rhythms.
- Play along with the recordings.
- End of A section semi quavers is off beat

# Swinging (not)

No swing! Bebop tunes don't swing! Only swing jazz swings.

The swing feel is achieved
- The drums
- The accenting on the offbeats

The melodic interest is generated through:
- Random accents
- Reduction of the melody
- Incredible tempo

Play the melody rock solid straight. No exceptions.
