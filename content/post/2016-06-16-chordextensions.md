This is a summary from the [/r/piano](www.reddit.com/r/piano)
 subreddit FAQ. User `onaz` gives a great summary on good chord extensions to use.

I have been playing around with Jazz piano for many years but knowing which extension to use for a chord often eludes me. Turns out there are actually systematic categories for each!

I will be assuming chords built of the tonic of `C` for each chord below. Because I'm a nooblet.

# Major7 chords
```nohighlight
C E G B
```

## Suitable extensions
### 9th

```nohighlight
C E G B D
```

This is a safe note to add for many different voicings

### #11
```nohighlight
C E G B F#
```

This comes from the lydian mode. A normal `11th` (or `4th`) would clash with the major seventh sound as it's an avoid note. However, when we raise the usual note a half-step, we get a very rich `#11` sound.

### 13th
```nohighlight
C E G B A
```

The `13th` (or `6th`) won't add very much color to a major seven chord because the function it provides is the same as the normal major seventh. We often talk about how major seven chords (like `Cmaj7`) are interchangable with sixth chords (like `C6`) because of their function.

## Upper Structure Triads

To get an instant `13(#11)` sound on a major chord, add a triad built from a whole step above the root.

- USII - e.g. D major over Cmaj7, resulting in C13♯11

So if we have a `Cmaj7` chord
```nohighlight
C E G B
```
We go a whole step above the root of the chord (which is a `C`). Then we take that note (`D`) and build a major triad from there. Now in addition to `C E G B`, we are adding `D F# A` to get a final chord of `C13(#11)`.
```nohighlight
C E G B D F# A
```

# Minor 7th chords
```nohighlight
C E G Bb
```

## Suitable extensions
### 9th
```nohighlight
C Eb G Bb D
```

Still a safe note to add.

### 11th
```nohighlight
C Eb G Bb F
```

This comes from the dorian mode and is a great note to add.

### 13th
```nohighlight
C Eb G Bb A
```

A good note to add in minor voicings.

## Upper Structure Triads

For minor 7th chords we can use a USii voicing, in this case the Dm. You'll get a Cm13!

- USii - e.g. D minor over Cm7, resulting in Cm13

```nohighlight
C Eb G Bb D F A
```

# 7th chords
```nohighlight
C E G Bb
```

Dominant chords provide the most opportunity for color. They are often used in transition and contain the most dissonance in a chord progression.

## Suitable extensions

### #5/b5
```nohighlight
C E Gb Bb
```
```nohighlight
C E G# Bb
```
These usually replace the normal fifth.

### 9
```nohighlight
C E G Bb D
```

Adds more color

### #9/b9
```nohighlight
C E G Bb Db
```

```nohighlight
C E G Bb D#
```

Altering the nine can give you a ton of color and disonnace very quickly

### 11
```nohighlight
C E G Bb F
```

This turns the chord into a sus chord. You'll see that written as `C7sus`. This is one of the least dissonant alterations you can make.

### #11
```nohighlight
C E G Bb F#
```

You'll notice that `#11` and b5 are the same note. `#11` is simply another way to think about it.

### 13
```nohighlight
C E G Bb A
```

Adds more colour (and is a standard addition to our four note rootless voicings.)

## Upper Structure Triads

The 7th chords are the most flexible here. You can use any of the following triads to alter the chord (from Wikipedia).

- USII - e.g. D major over C7, resulting in C13♯11

- US♭V - e.g. G♭ major over C7, resulting in C7♭9♯11

- US♭VI - e.g. A♭ major over C7, resulting in C7♯9♭13

- USVI - e.g. A major over C7, resulting in C13♭9

- USi - e.g. C minor over C7, resulting in C7♯9

- US♭ii - e.g. D♭ minor over C7, resulting in C7♭9 ♭13

- US♭iii - e.g. E♭ minor over C7, resulting in C7♯9♯11

# Additional Notes

Usually many of these alterations are used together to create a dissonant sound to the liking of the pianist. Often you'll see printed alterations in dominant chords caused by melody notes.

*Most often you will change combinations of the 5th and 9th to get a sound you like.*
