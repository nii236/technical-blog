This is a follow-up post from the previous post regarding building extended chords. I will be documenting how I come up with various voicings for [A Foggy Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Foggy_Day).

## Rules of thumb

- Repeating the melody an octave below is okay
- Avoid the fifth in favour of other intervals (including for the melody)
- Tritone subtitutions where suitable
- When the melody is on the fifth Reharmonisation it is possible to change the tonic to suit a more interesting interval.

## Bar 1

### Step 1 - Tonic and Melody

Figure out the following bits:

- Tonic: `F`
- Chord: `Fmaj7`
- Melody: `C` (the `5th`)

### Step 2 - 3rd and 7th shell voicing

- 3rd: `A`
- 7th: `B`

### Step 3a - Add Alterations

You also need to make sure the intervals between the alteration and the melody note is suitable. See the previous blog post for suitable alterations.

### Step 3b - Consider Context

#### Step 3b.1 Dominant V

Any dominant 7th chords acting as the fifth of the key centre can be switched with a tritone substitution, melody allowing.
