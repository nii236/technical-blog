Some new points today about playing modal jazz.

# Right Hand

- Quartal arpeggios sound good
- Minor pentatonic for m7
- Major pentatonic for 7
- Mixolydian has an avoid note (4th) for dominant chords
	- When played with quartal voicings, avoid note is no longer an avoid note
- Whole tone scale works for dominant chords

# Left Hand

- Left hand is triplets, right hand is straight quavers
- Stride pattern 1: and of 2, and of 4
- Stride pattern 2: and of 2, on 4

# Improvisation

- Play single chord vamp with left hand
- Start with a single note just crotchets
- Add second note
- Add third note
- Add quavers
- Profit
