      <description>&lt;p&gt;I often see people posting on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions&#34;&gt;/r/cscareerquestions&lt;/a&gt; subreddit questions about what is involved in migrating to a career of software development. I&amp;rsquo;m in the enviable position of having completed that step, and I&amp;rsquo;ll share my background in this article and will cover my migration to software development in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I graduated in 2008 with an Engineering bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Mechatronics. I enjoyed the work, and the combination of electronic, mechanical and programming was appealing to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up working as a vanilla mechanical engineer due to the job market at the time. I did it for 3 years, during which I worked on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Piping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Estimating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Construction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amongst other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep down I wasn&amp;rsquo;t getting the enjoyment I wanted out of it, mostly because there was nothing technologically oriented in my work. I made sure pipes were being delivered, I made sure mechanical steelwork was in the right place at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I switched to control systems engineering after 3 years. This was already a big career change and I had to start from the bottom again as a graduate. Working in control systems/process controls was amazing, and much much closer to my original vision of mechtronic engineering. I was working on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CitectSCADA (HMI design and software)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interfacing with vendor systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server setup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cisco switch setup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far so good! I was working with computers, I was working on industrial machinery, I was doing something I was actually good at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the disadvantages of working in the mining industry is that you need to be away from home for long periods of time. During my six years of my time in the mining industry, I was probably away for three of those. The last site gig I had required me to be away for an entire year, for 3 months at a time. In the middle of a jungle in Ghana, West Africa. It was a unique experience, but not one that I was willing to repeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a couple of years, I eventually got laid off from my (2nd) gig as a control systems engineer. Looking for further work posed a few problems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have much control systems experience (I was still a &amp;lsquo;graduate&amp;rsquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The job market was dying (dead?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What work was available, usually required being underpaid, sent to site, or shoved into a niche market such as vendor auditing stacker anti collision logic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I laid in bed after three months of job hunting, my girlfriend just said to me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re spending all your time tinkering around with computers. Why don&amp;rsquo;t you look for work in software development?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That got me thinking&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;go:ebf9963405bac373eb63012bc418035c&#34;&gt;Go&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friends know me as someone who is not very loyal. I don&amp;rsquo;t mean to my girlfriend. I mean to various technology and web stacks. Ever since the advent of node.js, frameworks, tooling and just weird stacks have popped up. Not that I&amp;rsquo;m complaining. I love reading about new frameworks, languages and development in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current interest is in &lt;a href=&#34;golang.org&#34;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;golang.org&#34;&gt;Golang&lt;/a&gt;. I won&amp;rsquo;t bother introducing it here, as I&amp;rsquo;ll just be repeating what others have said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been really interested in the language lately, and I look forward to building apps with it. One of the main limitations of Go at the moment is the lack of a proper UI library. There are some bindings to GTK/QT somewhere, but usually filled with bugs or some weird hackery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;electron:ebf9963405bac373eb63012bc418035c&#34;&gt;Electron&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also been looking into &lt;a href=&#34;http://electron.atom.io/&#34;&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt; lately. It used to be known as Atom Shell and has been rebranded recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electron allows people who are more experienced in Single Page App (SPA) style development to build apps for desktops. All signs point towards web apps as the future, but yet here is Electron and Atom enjoying success and adoption. It helps us lowly web developers to get our feet wet in desktop development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick read of Electron documentation suggests that it runs off a basic node.js server as the &lt;code&gt;main process&lt;/code&gt;. There are also many &lt;code&gt;renderer processes&lt;/code&gt; that can be spawned, and these will be your browser instances that will be presented to the end user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communication between the main and renderer processes are done by way of the ipc package that comes with Electron. So I&amp;rsquo;d imagine your main process handles most of the comms, state, and processing. One of the biggest complaints about node js is that when it blocks, it &lt;em&gt;really, really&lt;/em&gt; blocks. Single threaded execution means that as soon as you do some sort of heavy number crunching you&amp;rsquo;re screwed, and then everyone will start complaining about how your &lt;a href=&#34;http://atom.io/&#34;&gt;app&lt;/a&gt; is slow as molasses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;multi-tier-architecture:ebf9963405bac373eb63012bc418035c&#34;&gt;Multi tier architecture&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why not defer the processing intensive stuff to yet another process? Perhaps using another language that is well suited to portability (static binaries) and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is something called &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture&#34;&gt;multitier architecture&lt;/a&gt; that allows one to split up these concerns cleanly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have explored connecting a Go backend into Electron and have found reasonable success. The first iteration used a REST API, and my second attempt covers using gRPC instead, to great effect. I may have solved two problems in two different camps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance by the main process in Electron&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A UI toolkit for Go&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll continue these musings in part two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-hello-there:e8fb9c67eba912c72729806db31eaa1b&#34;&gt;Why hello there!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the initial post. I&amp;rsquo;ll be exploring various technology stacks during my journey to become a (more) competent developer.&lt;/p&gt;
